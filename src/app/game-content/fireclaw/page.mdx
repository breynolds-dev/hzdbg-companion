# The Fireclaw Expansion
Until now you have known many a fearsome quarry, and brought down each foe using skills learned on the trail.  Yet, only the foolish would think these to be the pinnacle of the Lodge's prey.  In the farthest flung wilds, far beyond the frontier you now know, more deadly and terrifying creatures await; and if you truly mean to earn yourself a place at the Lodge, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Hawks?  Look now then to these legendary machines as your next target.

*Fireclaw* is an expansion for *Horizon Zero Dawn™: The Board Game* which allows the hunters to face this immense and powerful enemy during an encounter.  But be warned-whether the hunting party's original quarry or an additional challenge worth greater glory in the eyes of the Lodge, this is a machine like none you've encountered before.

Are you ready for the challenge?

<Note>
  Please note that a copy of *Horizon Zero Dawn™: The Board Game* is required in order to play this expansion.

## Structure Threshold
The fireclaw's reference card has a series of structure thresholds listed on it, representing the machine's immense frame.  Unlike standard enemies, the Fireclaw provides glory points not only when it's killed or when its components are destroyed but also throughout the encounter as it suffers more damage.

Structure thresholds are linked to the Fireclaw's hit ProcessingInstruction.  If a hunter deals damage to the Fireclaw's hit points with an attack or by destroying a component that takes the Fireclaw's total damage above the next structure threshold, the hunter immediately gains 1 glory point.  If a hunter exceeds multiple structure thresholds in a single attack they gain glory points for each threshold they exceed.

## Multiple Components
The Fireclaw is a truly massive machine, with several systems of the same type that are linked together.  These components are represented by a multiplier next to the name, which indicates the enemy has multiple components of the same type that can be destroyed.

Unlike normal components, a component with this icon can be destroyed as many times as is indicated by the number listed next to the symbol.  Each time one of these components is destroyed, the hunter gains glory, and the players apply any effects and the damage listed to the Fireclaw before placing a destroyed token on the enemy.

When the Fireclaw has gained the number of tokens listed for that component, all of the components of that type have been destroyed, and the hunters may no longer target that component.
