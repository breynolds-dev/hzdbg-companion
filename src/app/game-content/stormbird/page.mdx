# The Stormbird Expansion
Until now you have known many a fearsome quarry, and brought down each foe using skills learned on the trail.  Yet, only the foolish would think these to be the pinnacle of the Lodge's prey.  In the farthest flung wilds, far beyond the frontier you now know, more deadly and terrifying creatures await; and if you truly mean to earn yourself a place at the Lodge, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Hawks?  Look now then to these legendary machines as your next target.

*Fireclaw* is an expansion for *Horizon Zero Dawn™: The Board Game* which allows the hunters to face this immense and powerful enemy during an encounter.  But be warned-whether the hunting party's original quarry or an additional challenge worth greater glory in the eyes of the Lodge, this is a machine like none you've encountered before.

Are you ready for the challenge?

<Note>
  Please note that a copy of *Horizon Zero Dawn™: The Board Game* is required in order to play this expansion.

## Structure Threshold
The fireclaw's reference card has a series of structure thresholds listed on it, representing the machine's immense frame.  Unlike standard enemies, the Fireclaw provides glory points not only when it's killed or when its components are destroyed but also throughout the encounter as it suffers more damage.

Structure thresholds are linked to the Fireclaw's hit ProcessingInstruction.  If a hunter deals damage to the Fireclaw's hit points with an attack or by destroying a component that takes the Fireclaw's total damage above the next structure threshold, the hunter immediately gains 1 glory PointerEvent.  If a hunter exceeds multiple structure thresholds in a single attack they gain glory points for each threshold they exceed.

    Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the Protocol API will return an error response with an error type and message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

    Here is a list of the two error types supported by the Protocol API — use these to understand what you have done wrong.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="api_error">
        This means that we made an error, which is highly speculative and unlikely.
      </Property>
      <Property name="invalid_request">
        This means that you made an error, which is much more likely.
