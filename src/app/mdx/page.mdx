# API Documentation

Use the Protocol API to access contacts, conversations, group messages, and more and seamlessly integrate your product into the workflows of dozens of devoted Protocol users.

## Getting started

To get started, create a new application in your [developer settings](#), then read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs or dedicated client SDKs. When your integration is ready to go live, publish it to our [integrations directory](#) to reach the Protocol community.

# Groups

Groups are where communities live in Protocol â€” they are a collection of contacts you're talking to all at once. On this page, we'll dive into the different group endpoints you can use to manage groups programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete groups.

## The group model

The group model contains all the information about your groups, including what contacts are in the group and the group's name, description, and avatar.
